## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me gain experience with web design ,CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid, Mobile-first workflow, and element positioning. Also in this challenge I had to use data from a JSON file to simulate an API. This helped me understand Fetch API better.

### Continued development

Even if this project looks completed, there will still be always something to improve on it.
I intend on creating a new branch for an NodeJS or Express JS project that will use this frontend.
